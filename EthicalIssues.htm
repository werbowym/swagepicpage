<h1> Ethical Issues </h1>

<ol>
<li>Identity Theft: Millions of people have some of their identity stolen and then sold on the internet. Credit card numbers, banking information, social security numbers, addresses, basic information, and more are sought after to be sold to others on the internet. People must be very aware of the dangers of putting their information on the internet otherwise someone may steal their identity and do harm while pretending to be them.
<li>Phishing: Fake emails are sent in an attempt to trick people into giving up their personal data or to install harmful software. Many fake emails will pretend to be some harmless email that was sent to the wrong person and will try to trick people into opening an attachment. Once this is done often a virus can be installed or malware can be put in place and activated. 
<li>Fake Websites: Fake websites try to appear as legitimate websites to get people to willingly give up their private information. These websites will try to mock the appearance of ecommerce websites like Walmart, Ebay, Kijiji, Dell, Microsoft, or any website that requires sensitive information to be inputted. This allows thieves to gain anything from account logins on instagram, to working credit card numbers if people donâ€™t ensure they are on the right and real website before they input personal information.
<li>DDOS: A designated denial of service attack is when several computers overwhelm a website with too many requests and cause it to fail. The cause of these attacks can be for fun, a test of skills, or intentional attacks planned to cripple a company. Either way they are harmful and can cause serious damage to servers.
<li>Recording: Many companies are accused of turning on camera's and microphone's of devices to record data on it's users. Different laws surround the legality of this and how to properly prove that it is being done. But none the less, there are still companies or hackers who are capable of breaching your privacy and recording you.
